## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in **CG-SQL-author**, please report it
responsibly using GitHub’s private vulnerability reporting feature:

https://github.com/ricomariani/CG-SQL-author/security/advisories/new

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue** for security-related problems.

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce (if possible)
- The potential impact
- Any suggested mitigation or fix

We will review reports as quickly as possible and work toward a resolution.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest released version is currently supported with security updates.

## Disclosure

Please allow a reasonable amount of time for investigation and remediation
before any public disclosure.

## Backup Plan

If the advisory does not get attention please open a public issue stating you
have a security issue without giving details. The maintainer will give you
alternative direct contact instructions.
