Note that the project is no longer maintained by Meta.  Meta stopped publishing
updates or accepting pulls some months ago. However, the original license
requires the original copyright and so it is included here and will continue
to be included.  Other contributions are licensed under the same terms
including those that came well after Meta's involvement ended.

Meta continues to make periodic ad hoc contributions to this fork and merge
corrections back to their private repo.  The maintainer thanks Meta
for this continued informal cooperation.

I have begun the practice of tagging the copyright of individual files with the
copyright owner, which is sometimes not Meta.  It seems not appropriate to
tag entirely with the Meta tag.  However, the entire work continues to be
licensed uniformly with the MIT license above.
