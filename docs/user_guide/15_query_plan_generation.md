CQL offers a way to run SQLite's [`EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` command](https://www.sqlite.org/eqp.html)
for all the SQL statements used in a CQL file using a set of special
compilation steps.

Generating query plans is inherently complicated. Any given stored
procedure might include many SQL statements, each of which has a
plan. To get the plans, those statements must be executed in the
appropriate mode. In order for them to execute, whatever tables, views,
and user-defined functions they use must exist. The statements can have
any number of parameters, those have to be swapped out because they might
come from anywhere. When run in `--rt query_plan` mode, the compiler
accomplishes all of this by analyzing the original code and creating
entirely new code. Running this new code creates the schema and, with
the appropriate transforms, runs all the SQL statements in the original
to give us the query plans. The process requires many steps as we'll
see below.

### Query Plan Generation Compilation Steps

>TIP:
>The following steps are used in `./repl/go_query_plan.sh`, you can [run it to get a quick demonstration of this feature in action](../quick_start/playground.md#query-plan-playground).
>The rest of the section explains how query plan generation works and some of its quirks.

To execute query plans for a given CQL file, the following commands need to be run:

```bash
CQL_FILE= # The CQL file to compile
CQL_ROOT_DIR= # Path to cql directory
CQL=$CQL_ROOT_DIR/out/cql

# Standard compile flags
CC="cc -I$CQL_ROOT_DIR -I."
set -e

# Generate Query Plan Script
echo $CQL --in $CQL_FILE --rt query_plan --cg go-qp.sql
$CQL --in $CQL_FILE --rt query_plan --cg go-qp.sql

# Compile and link CQL artifacts, with a main C file query_plan_test.c
$CQL --in go-qp.sql --cg go-qp.h go-qp.c --dev

$CC -c $CQL_ROOT_DIR/query_plan_test.c go-qp.c
$CC -c go-qp.c
$CC -o go-qp go-qp.o query_plan_test.o $CQL_ROOT_DIR/cqlrt.c -lsqlite3

# Run and generate query plans
./go-qp
```

In order to flexibily create query plans, CQL uses `--rt query_plan`
to generate a second CQL script that returns query plans for each SQL
statement used in a given file.

The CQL repository provides the file
[`query_plan_test.c`](https://github.com/ricomariani/CG-SQL-author/blob/main/sources/query_plan_test.c) that can be used
as the "main" function, otherwise you can make your own.

>NOTE: >When compiling the CQL file generated by `--rt query_plan`, the
>`--dev` flag is required.

### Special Handling of CQL features in Query Plan Generation
CQL's query planner generator modifies the usage of the following features to allow SQLite run `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` successfully:

- Variables
- User Defined Functions
- Conditionals in Shared Fragments
- [Virtual Tables](https://sqlite.org/vtab.html)
- [Table-Valued Funcxtions](https://sqlite.org/vtab.html#tabfunc2)

> CAUTION:
> Generating query plans for CQL files that use table valued functions, or virtual tables
> results in the creation of similarly named "normal" tables which will be using in the query instead
> of the virtual table or table -valued function.
> This means that the query plan output won't be quite right, especially if these items had complex interiors
> with nested SQLite queries, but it also means the code that generates
> the query plans does not need to have all of your native bindings for the relevant modules and functions
> which make it possible to actually run the queries out of context in a standalone build.

#### Variables

Variables used in SQL statements are stubbed into constants. The exact
value varies depending on the type of the variable, but it is always
equivalent to some form of `"1"`.

```sql
...
SELECT *
FROM my_table
WHERE id = x;
...
```

```sql
...
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
SELECT *
FROM my_table
WHERE my_table.id = nullable(1);
...
```

#### User Defined Functions

_Read [Functions](./08_functions.md) on details about Function Types._

Since the implementation of UDFs in a CQL file do not affect SQLite
query plans, CQL's query plan script automatically creates no-op stubs
to be used instead.

#### Conditionals in Shared Fragments

_Read [CQL Query Fragments](./14_shared_fragments.md) on details about shared fragments_

Only one branch of a conditional is chosen for query plan analysis. By
default this will be the first branch, which is the initial
`SELECT` statement following the `IF` conditional.  The branch
to analyze can be configured with the `cql:query_plan_branch`
[@attribute](./appendices/03_control_directives.md)

Here's an example of `cql:query_plan_branch` being used:

```sql
[[shared_fragment]]
[[query_plan_branch=1]]
CREATE PROC frag2(y int)
BEGIN
  IF y == 2 THEN
    SELECT 10 b;
  ELSE IF y == -1 THEN
    SELECT 20 b;
  ELSE
    SELECT 30 b;
  END IF;
END;
```

```sql
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
SELECT 20 b;
```

Setting `cql:query_plan_branch=1` selects the second branch. Providing
`cql:query_plan_branch=2` instead would yield the `ELSE` clause `SELECT 30 b`.
`cql:query_plan_branch=0` would yield `SELECT 10 b`, which is
the same as the default behaviour.
