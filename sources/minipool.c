// This is the stupidest pool allocator ever, it's only useful for cases where
// everything lives until the end.  Currently it's used to hold ast nodes and
// duplicated strings.  It may hold more.  The old CQL strategy was to just let
// `exit` clean up everything since we were only an executable and we can't free
// the tree until we're exiting anyway.  However there is some desire to use CQL
// in library form now which means it has to be able to do a compile and then
// end up clean.  To help with this we make these ultra-dumb pools that simply
// keep the allocated items together.  This means that we don't have to do
// zillions of seperate free calls when we're done (and not exiting).  It also
// helps with locality and fragmentation in the client. It's dumb as rocks.
